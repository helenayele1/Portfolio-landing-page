    <p> <em>About Me:</em> Hey there! A little about myself, I'm an avid traveler, bookworm, and food enthusiast. I love exploring new places, immersing myself in captivating stories, and trying out diverse cuisines at local restaurants. Volunteering at non-profits gives me a sense of fulfillment, and being outdoors brings me joy and tranquility. I thrive on challenging myself with new experiences and continuously learning. </p>

    <p> <em>My Background:</em> I have a background as an engineering coordinator, where I developed a strong interest in coding and technology. Recognizing the potential for growth and new opportunities in the field, I made the decision to enroll in a coding bootcamp. Through the bootcamp, I am acquiring the necessary skills to <strong>transition into a career in coding</strong>. I am excited about the prospect of leveraging these newfound abilities to explore new avenues and achieve greater professional growth</p>
